      "answer": "Thought: The user is asking for policy-wise information for customer code 8000115009, specifically for policies under the \"main branch\" and with \"Major type is group life\".\nThe query results provide data for 'GROUP LIFE & MEDICAL' policies for the specified customer. I need to present this data clearly, policy by policy, including all requested fields: Customer Code, Customer Name, Major, Minor, Business Type, Policy year, Policy Number, Sum Insured, Premium, Total Claim, and Loss Ratio.\n\nI will structure the response by:\n1.  Directly answering the question by stating the policies found for the customer under the specified criteria.\n2.  Presenting the data in a clear, tabular or list format for each policy.\n3.  Adding business context for each metric (Sum Insured, Premium, Total Claim, Loss Ratio).\n4.  Highlighting any important insights, such as the consistent zero claims and loss ratio across all listed policies.\n5.  Summarizing the key findings.\n\nLet's break down the data presentation:\n-   **Customer Code & Name**: Consistent for all rows.\n-   **Major**: Consistent 'GROUP LIFE & MEDICAL' which fits the \"group life\" major type requested (as 'GROUP LIFE & MEDICAL' typically encompasses group life).\n-   **Minor**: 'Group Medical (DohaCare)' - important to note this specific minor type.\n-   **Business Type**: 'Co-Insurance' - provides context on the policy structure.\n-   **Policy Year & Number**: Unique identifiers for each policy entry.\n-   **Sum Insured**: Monetary value, format as currency.\n-   **Premium**: Monetary value, format as currency.\n-   **Total Claim**: Monetary value, format as currency.\n-   **Loss Ratio**: Percentage, format as percentage.\n\nObservations from the data:\n-   All policies are under 'GROUP LIFE & MEDICAL' and 'Group Medical (DohaCare)'.\n-   All policies show 'Total Claim' as 0 and 'Loss Ratio' as 0. This is a significant insight.\n-   'Sum Insured' is 0 for some policies (2021, 2022) which could indicate a specific policy structure or data entry.\n\nI will ensure to explain what a zero loss ratio means in an insurance context.For customer **8000115009, Ezdan Holding Group**, the following policies under the **Group Life & Medical** major type have been identified, displaying their key policy details, financial figures, and loss ratios:\n\nHere is the detailed policy-wise information:\n\n---\n\n**Policy Details for Customer: 8000115009 - Ezdan Holding Group**\n\n*   **Major Policy Type:** GROUP LIFE & MEDICAL\n*   **Minor Policy Type:** Group Medical (DohaCare)\n*   **Business Type:** Co-Insurance\n\n| Policy Year | Policy Number | Sum Insured (QAR) | Premium (QAR) | Total Claim (QAR) | Loss Ratio (%) |\n| :---------- | :------------ | :---------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :------------- |\n| 2019        | 26            | 84,958,500.00     | 1,201,777.50    | 0.00              | 0.00%          |\n| 2020        | 25            | 64,362,500.00     | 639,389.75      | 0.00              | 0.00%          |\n| 2021        | 27            | 0.00              | 853,304.00      | 0.00              | 0.00%          |\n| 2022        | 51            | 0.00              | 644,011.00      | 0.00              | 0.00%          |\n| 2023        | 86            | 39,650,000.00     | 701,655.12      | 0.00              | 0.00%          |\n| 2025        | 124           | 4,800,000.00      | 46,341.00       | 0.00              | 0.00%          |\n| 2025        | 125           | 45,440,000.00     | 931,078.00      | 0.00              | 0.00%          |\n\n---\n\n**Business Context and Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Customer Code & Name:** The data pertains to customer **8000115009**, \"Ezdan Holding Group\".\n*   **Major & Minor Policy Type:** All listed policies fall under \"GROUP LIFE & MEDICAL\" with a specific minor type of \"Group Medical (DohaCare)\". This indicates that these are corporate medical insurance policies providing health coverage to a group of individuals (employees or members) associated with Ezdan Holding Group.\n*   **Business Type:** The \"Co-Insurance\" business type suggests a structure where the policyholder (Ezdan Holding Group) shares a portion of the risk or premium with the insurer.\n*   **Sum Insured:** This represents the maximum liability of the insurer for the coverage provided under the policy. For policies in 2021 and 2022, the 'Sum Insured' is recorded as 0. This could indicate a specific policy arrangement where the sum insured is not explicitly stated or is managed differently, or it might refer to a specific type of coverage within the broader Group Medical policy where this metric isn't applicable in the same way.\n*   **Premium:** This is the amount paid by the policyholder for the insurance coverage. The premiums vary across years, reflecting changes in coverage, group size, or policy terms.\n*   **Total Claim:** This represents the total amount paid out by the insurer for claims filed under each policy.\n*   **Loss Ratio:** Calculated as (Total Claim / Premium) * 100, the loss ratio is a key indicator of an insurance policy's profitability. A higher loss ratio means more claims are paid relative to premiums collected.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n*   **Zero Claims and Loss Ratio:** A notable pattern across all listed policies from 2019 to 2025 is a **Total Claim of QAR 0.00** and a **Loss Ratio of 0.00%**. This indicates that for these specific Group Medical (DohaCare) policies, no claims were reported or paid out during their respective policy years, or claims were managed under a different financial arrangement not reflected in this specific claim metric.\n*   **Consistent Policy Type:** The customer consistently holds 'Group Medical (DohaCare)' policies under the 'GROUP LIFE & MEDICAL' major type, suggesting a long-term relationship for employee health benefits.\n*   **Varying Sum Insured and Premiums:** While claims are zero, the 'Sum Insured' and 'Premium' amounts show fluctuations year-over-year. This is typical for group policies, which are often renewed annually and can be adjusted based on the number of covered individuals, their age profiles, chosen benefits, and market conditions. The zero Sum Insured for 2021 and 2022 policies is an anomaly worth investigating further if more context is needed.\n\n**Summary of Key Findings:**\n\nFor Ezdan Holding Group (customer code 8000115009), the analysis of their Group Life & Medical policies (specifically Group Medical (DohaCare)) from 2019 to 2025 reveals consistent policy renewals with varying premiums and sum insured amounts. A significant finding is that all these policies show a **0% loss ratio**, indicating that no claims were recorded against these specific policies during the periods analyzed.",

While 2019 and 2020 policies had favorable loss ratios (77.05% and 50.82% respectively), indicating strong underwriting results, the policies from 2021, 2022, and 2023 experienced loss ratios significantly above 100% (123.02%, 119.81%, and 118.72% respectively). This indicates that for these years, the total claims paid exceeded the premiums earned, suggesting a period of higher claims frequency or severity. The policies for 2025 are new and currently show no claims activity, which is typical for recently issued policies. The recurring QAR 0.00 Sum Insured for policies in 2021 and 2022 warrants further investigation to understand the specific policy structure or data recording practices for these years.",

These figures indicate the monetary value of the insurance policies held by these customers with the main branch. Higher premiums often correlate with larger assets, greater risk exposure, or more comprehensive coverage.\n*   **Dominant Customer:** QatarEnergy LNG stands out significantly, with a premium of over QAR 471 million, which is more than three times the premium of the second-ranked customer, Qatar Airways Co. This highlights the critical importance of QatarEnergy LNG as a key revenue generator for the main branch.\n*   **Diverse Portfolio:** The list includes a mix of government-related entities (Qatar Armed Forces, KAHRAMAA), major national corporations (Qatar Airways, Qatar Aluminium, Qatar Steel, Dolphin Energy, Qatar Energy), and international branches (McDermott Middle East), demonstrating the broad reach and diverse client base of the main branch.\n*   **Strategic Importance:** Identifying these top customers is crucial for strategic account management, ensuring customer satisfaction, and potentially identifying opportunities for cross-selling or up-selling additional insurance products.

This list underscores the branch's strong relationships with major national and international entities, essential for its overall financial performance and strategic planning.",
