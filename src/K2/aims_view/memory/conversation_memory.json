      "answer": "Thought: I have received a user request to list claims for customer code 1212000028, detailing policy year, policy number, policy type, policy line of business, claim number, claim accident date, claim status, and claim accident year, organized policy-wise.\n\nHowever, the `EVALUATION RESULT` indicates `status: PARTIAL` and `QUERY RESULTS SUMMARY` is empty. This means the system was unable to fully retrieve the requested data.\n\nMy task is to generate a comprehensive, user-friendly response even without the specific data. I must:\n1. Directly answer the user's question, acknowledging the inability to retrieve data.\n2. Explain *what* information would have been provided, demonstrating understanding of the request and AIMS domain.\n3. Provide business context on the importance of such information.\n4. Structure the response clearly.\n5. Offer next steps.\n\nGiven the lack of data, I will explain that the claim details for customer 1212000028 could not be fully retrieved at this time due to an incomplete query. I will then outline the specific details that would have been presented, following the user's requested format, and explain the business significance of each data point.Unfortunately, I was unable to retrieve the complete claim details for customer code **1212000028** at this moment. The query execution was partial, meaning the necessary data could not be fully fetched to generate the specific list of claims you requested.\n\nHad the data been available, I would have provided a detailed breakdown, organized policy-wise, for all claims under the main branch for this customer. This would typically include:\n\n*   **Policy Information:**\n    *   **Policy Year:** The year the policy was issued or renewed, indicating the coverage period.\n    *   **Policy Number:** The unique identifier for each insurance policy, crucial for tracking.\n    *   **Policy Type:** The specific kind of insurance policy (e.g., Auto, Property, Liability), defining its scope of coverage.\n    *   **Policy Line of Business (Major):** The primary category of insurance business the policy falls under (e.g., Personal Lines, Commercial Auto), providing a higher-level classification.\n\n*   **Claim Information (associated with each policy):**\n    *   **Claim Number:** The unique identifier assigned to each reported incident, essential for claim processing and tracking.\n    *   **Claim Accident Date:** The specific date when the incident leading to the claim occurred, vital for establishing coverage and liability.\n    *   **Claim Status:** The current stage of the claim (e.g., Open, Closed, Denied, In Review), indicating its progress and resolution.\n    *   **Claim Accident Year:** The year in which the accident or incident took place, used for historical analysis and reporting.\n\n**Business Context and Importance:**\nThis level of detail is critical for comprehensive customer service and claims management. Understanding the policies associated with a customer and the status of their claims provides a holistic view of their insurance profile. It allows for:\n*   **Efficient Claim Handling:** Quickly identifying claim status and accident details.\n*   **Policy Review:** Correlating claims with specific policy types and coverage periods.\n*   **Customer Support:** Providing accurate and timely information to the customer regarding their claims and policies.\n*   **Risk Assessment:** Analyzing claim frequency and types against policy lines of business.\n\n**Summary of Key Findings (Expected):**\nWhile the specific data could not be provided, the goal was to present a clear, policy-wise list of claims for customer 1212000028, encompassing key policy identifiers (year, number, type, line of business) and critical claim details (number, accident date, status, accident year). This information is fundamental for managing customer relationships and claims effectively within the AIMS domain.\n\nI recommend re-attempting the query or checking the underlying data sources to resolve the partial execution and retrieve the requested information.",

This means that no data was returned for the specified criteria.\nTherefore, I cannot list any customers as requested.

Branch names can sometimes have slight variations (e.g., \"Shamil Branch\" vs. \"shamil\").\n*   Consider broadening your search criteria or checking for customers across all branches if you are unsure about the specific branch name.\n*   If you believe there should be customers under this branch, further investigation into the data entry or branch setup might be necessary.\n\nIn summary, no top 10 customers by premium could be identified for the 'shamil' branch as no relevant data was retrieved.",
