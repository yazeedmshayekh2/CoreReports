## Features Breakdown

### Feature 1: Oracle Database Connection & Data Access üîê

**Feature Description:**
The Oracle Database Connection & Data Access feature provides a secure, robust foundation for the CoreReports system by establishing connectivity to the AIMS Oracle database. Based on the existing implementation in `SecureOracleDBUtils` class, this feature includes a comprehensive set of security measures including input validation, SQL injection prevention, rate limiting, and connection pooling. The system currently uses cx_Oracle driver with Unicode/Arabic support and implements enterprise-grade error handling and SSL configuration.

The existing code already provides:
- Environment variable-based configuration (`DB_SERVER_CORE`, `DB_SERVICE_CORE`, etc.)
- A robust `InputValidator` class with validation for national IDs, phone numbers, and names (including Arabic)
- SQL query validation and sanitization
- In-memory rate limiting (100 requests/hour per client)
- Connection pooling with Unicode support
- SSL/TLS configuration via a dedicated `ssl_config.py` module
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Test connection functionality

The feature will enhance these capabilities to create a complete CoreReports database foundation.
